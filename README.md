# Automatic Prescription Medicine Monitoring System
In order to improve medication adherence of the patient, this project proposes an APMM smart pill box based on an automatic prescription medicine monitoring system. The
APMM smart pill box is based on MKR WiFi 1010, which transmits medication data of the patient to the web appliction via WiFi. The smart pill box can effectively monitor
the patient taking the medicine at the correct time, and remind the patient to take the medicine at a specific time. The APMM smart pill box establishes a patient medication information sharing platform among patients, family members and carers, which records and displays all medication event data to the web application deployed on the cloud server.
